      press E!\r\nTo escape, you need to get the software project released, it doesn\u2019t
      matter in what condition it just needs to be released! \nTo ensure this, at
      night you must enter the real world to find the computers that have been left
      on so you can help or hinder the project!  I have made the computers left logged
      on glow green when you get close to them and glow blue if they\u2019re locked!\r\nYou
      won\u2019t remember this as they would have wiped your memory, but last time
      you did this you failed because you changed too much and the developers realised
      you had escaped. \r\nThis time there is a Yellow bar that you can see to the
      left. You can\u2019t fill the bar otherwise the developers will know you have
      escaped and trapped you in the software again!\n Below that is a battery indicator
      if that hits zero you die! To keep it charge control any blue or green glowing
      object and you will be recharged promptly. \r\nTo assist in movement, I\u2019ve
      installed Data Over Power module.\n"
