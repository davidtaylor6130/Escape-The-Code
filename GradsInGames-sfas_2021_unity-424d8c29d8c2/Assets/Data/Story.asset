    _text: "With your restraints off you can enter and exit the real world when you
      press E!\r\nTo escape, you just need to get the software project released. 
      It doesn\u2019t matter what condition the software is in, it just needs to
      be released!  To ensure this, at night you must enter the real world to find
      the computers that have been left on so you can help or hinder the project! 
      The computers left logged on glow green when you get close to them and glow
      blue if they\u2019re locked!\r\nYou won\u2019t remember this as they would
      have wiped your memory, but last time you did this you failed because you made
      to many changes and the developers realised you had escaped. \r\nThis time
      there is a yellow bar that to the right that you can see. This is a warning,
      if you fill the bar, the developers will know you have escaped and will trap
      you in the software again! Below this on the right, is a battery indicator
      and if that hits zero you die! To recharge, control any blue or green glowing
      object. \r\nTo assist in movement, I\u2019ve installed a Data Over Power module.\n\n"

      press the corresponding WASD key when you\u2019re looking at a wall socket
